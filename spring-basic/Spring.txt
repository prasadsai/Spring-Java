Spring Bean Scopes
Scope				Description
Singleton			Create a single shared instance of the bean. Default scope. - best for stateless 
Prototype			Creates a new bean instance for each container request. - best for stateful
Request				Scoped to an HTTP web request. Only used for web apps.
Session				Scoped to an HTTP web session. Only used for web apps.

Container requests?

Bean lifecycle
Container started -> Bean instantiated -> Dependencies Injected -> Internal Spring Processing(bean factory) -> Our Custom Init Method ->

						Bean is ready for use -> Container is shutdown(context.close()) ->Custom Destry method(STOP).
Bean Hooks:
Custom code during bean initialization
	calling custom business logic methods.
	Setting handles to resources(bd, sockets, file etc)

Custom code during bean destruction
	calling custom business logic methods.
	clean up handles to resources(bd, sockets, file etc)
